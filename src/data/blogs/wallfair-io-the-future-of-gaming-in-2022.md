# WALLFAIR.IO: THE FUTURE OF GAMING IN 2022

Along with being the most innovative gambling platform, we want to start publishing a series of blog articles on gaming showing users and investors the growth potential of the market and our focus of attention on providing a global entertainment value for our entire user base.

Our today&#39;s article is dedicated to Wallfair&#39;s view of the Virtual Reality technology (VR) and immersive gaming strategy in 2022.

With the use of VR, players can enjoy a near-to-reality experience as they are physically active and involved in the game. Currently, several active competitive leagues use VR. Hence, developers are now focusing on AR/VR technology to differentiate games in the market.

By 2022, players are going to [spend USD 6 billion on immersive gaming](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/16/2017095/0/en/Global-Gaming-Market-to-Witness-a-CAGR-of-12-During-2020-2025-Players-Will-Spend-4-5-Billion-on-Immersive-Gaming-in-2020.html) – a much more exciting and convenient gaming universe than the traditional scenarios offering the following major benefits:

## For Consumers

- **Immersive experience.** It is VR games, which not only allow to observe the game but to get inside of it. 360-video content and solid graphics give a feeling of physical presence.
- **A new level of interaction.** The release of controllers made the interaction within VR surroundings even more enjoyable. Now players can control and alter the game environment at their own will.
- **Content.** VR technology is maturing and promotes creating new gaming content. Genres like adventures, shooters or simulations, became famous thanks to VR. The familiar role of a protagonist is gaining value.

## For Businesses

- **New experiences.** Since VR devices are still quite costly, some companies open VR clubs at malls to allow people to try out virtual reality games. As the end-result, it potentially drives more sales.
- **Consumer Loyalty.** As soon as an individual made the first try of VR game, the chances are high for him/her to become your long-term customer. Feeling of presence and new sensations of VR surely intensify gaming experiences.
- **A new marketing tool.** Many video games have been presented on the big screen, cable networks, Netflix and other media channels and incorporated into the pop culture beyond regular playing platforms (Mortal Kombat, GTA, Marvel comics, DC comics, etc.). This has created an enormous marketing opportunity for the products presented in-game and associated with the games – a great example is Star Wars, the creator of the perfect marketing operation machinery based on a movie series.

## Blockchain And 5G Offer New Opportunities

Not only VR and AR can be considered as the future of gaming. The impact of blockchain technology on games also provides a great perspective on the growth of the industry. Blockchain offers useful tools for players, including decentralized asset exchanges, verifiable scarcity of virtual objects and collectibles, fast and secure payments, and the ability for developers to monetize their games.

Finally, 5G is ready and offers 10x the speed compared to 4G. 5G is going to significantly streamline online gaming, especially when it comes to high loaded live casino streams and playing on the go as lagging and buffering streams can become a problem of the past. Thus far, China, the UK, and the USA and a part of the EU rolled out 5G bringing better online casinos and 4K streaming accessible to all.

## Growing Internet Engagement Drives The Demand

According to GlobalWebIndex&#39;s data, [more than 1 billion people](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/16/2017095/0/en/Global-Gaming-Market-to-Witness-a-CAGR-of-12-During-2020-2025-Players-Will-Spend-4-5-Billion-on-Immersive-Gaming-in-2020.html) (a quarter of all internet users) watch live streams of other people playing games monthly. The number of internet users in developing markets has grown dramatically in the last years due to the global spreading of Chinese smartphone manufacturers suggesting cheap smartphones and local government investment in mobile internet infrastructure.

## Better Bonuses For Players In Online Casinos

In 2019, the UKGC (UK Gambling Commission) seriously took up casino bonuses, their advertising and related conditions. In short, the commission announced [new rules for online gambling in Britain](https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news-action-and-statistics/News/new-rules-to-make-online-gambling-in-britain-fairer-and-safer) to make things fairer, safer, and more profitable for the player.

While some older websites have generally been unwilling to react to this, newer online casinos, and especially bingo sites in the course of 2021, started offering casino bonuses with much lowered or no wagering requirements. Mainly, this has been achieved by offering free tickets or free spins instead of cash bonuses and players are free to make withdrawals as they want.

For 2022, players can expect better casino bonuses that work for them, are easier to understand and can be withdrawn at any point.

## Indie Studios Break Through

Indie studios have always done their best to get more clients, while the iGaming landscape has been long occupied by a handful of highly successful and mature companies.

As smaller studios often create bespoke casino titles as well as innovative games, all this can change in 2022. The bigger game publishers started to take the best small studios under their platforms, meaning we can expect to play games from more indie studios.

Industry leaders like Microgaming, Scientific Games, and NetEnt have started to acquire, partner, or license the game tech and concepts from smaller companies, aggregating their titles under one platform and letting millions of players have access to them. But this has also led to players feeling a lack of quality control was in place.

## Conclusion

To summarize our predictions for the future of gaming sector, we have identified key trends to expect this year:

- E-sports is one of the most attractive businesses for publishers. Its growth is believed to be sustainable for the coming years in both developed and developing markets.
- VR becomes more accessible, attracts new customers, and can be a new marketing tool.
- Blockchain and 5G offer new opportunities with faster internet, secure payments, ability to monetize games properly, and more.
- New regulations restrict online gambling setting rules that are more beneficial for players, at least in Britain.

With the virus influencing many aspects of everyone&#39;s day-to-day lives, it&#39;s also set to influence most business sectors.
