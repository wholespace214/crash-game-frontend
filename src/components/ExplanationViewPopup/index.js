            you can now bet on various exciting events while enjoying the
            stream!
          </p>

          <p>
            To participate, simply choose an event that has an active live

            choose your desired outcome(s)!
          </p>

          <p>
            In case the probability of your chosen outcome has deviated from
            your target, you can sell your position at any time before the event
            ends.

            Events are bets around various topics that are not live streamed but
            can be traded in the same simplicity.
          </p>

          <p>
            You simply choose an event, enter how much you want to trade and
            select between 2-4 outcomes and see how much return you make. You
            can place a bet in seconds from any where.That simple it is.
          </p>

          <p>
            Btw, you can “sell” your positions at any time, When the propability
            of your choice has gone up, you can sell any time before the event
            ends at a profit.
          </p>

          <p>
            Also, you can share, chat, see event details, trading history and
            your open positions.

          <p>Elon Game is super fun and easy to use.</p>

          <p>
            Elon tanks his rocket with {TOKEN_NAME} tokens that users place
            before the rocket takes off.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the journey to Mars, the value of {TOKEN_NAME} tokens increases
            and you can (and should) cash out your position any time on the
            journey. But don’t wait too long, at some point the rocket crashes
            and the {TOKEN_NAME} tokens that are still in the rocket crash with
            it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Elon is known for a good surprise, so you might come across NFT
            rewards and special gifts at any future time.
