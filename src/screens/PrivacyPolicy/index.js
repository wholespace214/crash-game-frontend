            We, Wallfair.io (Rosi Development GmbH), are delighted that you have
            shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a
            particularly high priority for the management of Wallfair. Our
            transparency document according to Art. 13 and 14 GDPR is available
            upon request.
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of the website is possible without any indication of
            personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special
            enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data
            could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is
            necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we
            generally obtain consent from the data subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail
            address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in
            line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in
            accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations
            applicable. By means of this data protection declaration, our
            enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature,
            scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process.
            Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data
            protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a data Controller, Wallfair has implemented numerous technical
            and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection
            of personal data processed through this website. However,
            Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security
            gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason,
            every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via
            alternative means, e.g. by telephone.
          </p>
          <strong>1 Definitions</strong>
          This data protection declaration is based on the terms used by the
          European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection
          Regulation (GDPR). It is prepared to be legible and understandable for
          the general public, as well as our customers and business partners. To
          ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used. In
          this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following
          terms:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong> Personal data</strong>
              Personal data means any information relating to an identified or
              identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An identifiable
              natural person is one who can be identified, directly or
              indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a
              name, an identification number, location data, an online
              identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical,
              physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social
              identity of that natural person.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Data subject</strong>
              Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person,
              whose personal data is processed by the Controller responsible for
              the processing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Processing</strong>
              Processing is any operation or set of operations which is
              performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or
              not by automated means, such as collection, recording,
              organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration,
              retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission,
              dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or
              combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Restriction of processing</strong>
              Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data
              with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Profiling</strong>
              Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data
              consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain
              personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to
              analyze or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s
              performance at work, economic situation, health, personal
              preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location or
              movements.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Pseudonymization</strong>
              Pseudonymization is the processing of personal data in such a
              manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a
              specific data subject without the use of additional information,
              provided that such additional information is kept separately and
              is subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure that
              the personal data are not attributed to an identified or
              identifiable natural person.

              receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in
              accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as
              recipients; the processing of those data by those public
              authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data
              protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.
            </li>

          <strong>4 Cookies</strong>
          <p>
            {' '}
            Our website uses cookies, text files that are stored in a computer
            system via an internet browser. Many Internet sites and servers use
            cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is
            a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string
            through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the
            specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This
            allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the
            individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers
            that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be
            recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through the use of cookies, Wallfair can provide the users of this
            website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible
            without the cookie setting.
          </p>
          <p>
            {' '}
            By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can
            be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously
            mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this
            recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website.
            The website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter
            access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken
            over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user’s
            computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in
            an online shop. The online store remembers the articles that a
            customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.
          </p>
          <p>
            {' '}
            The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies
            through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the
            Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of
            cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time
            via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible
            in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates
            the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all
            functions of our website may be entirely usable.
          </p>
          <strong>5 Collection of General Data and Information</strong>
          <p>
            Our website collects a series of general data and information when a
            data subject or automated system calls up the website. This general
            data and information are stored in the server log files. Collected
            may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating
            system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an
            accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the
            sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site,
            (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the internet
            service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar
            data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our
            information technology systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            When using these general data and information, we do not draw any
            conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is
            needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2)
            optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement,
            (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology
            systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement
            authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution
            in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, we analyze anonymously
            collected data and information statistically with the help of Google
            Analytics, Yandex Metrica and Hotjar, with the aim of increasing the
            data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure
            an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The
            anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from
            all personal data provided by a data subject. You have the option to
            familiarize yourselves with the Privacy Policies of the service
            providers under the following links:

          <strong>6 Registration</strong>
          <p>
            The data subject has the possibility to register on the website of
            the Controller with the indication of personal data. The personal
            data transmitted to the Controller is determined by the respective
            input mask used for the registration. The personal data entered by
            the data subject are collected and stored exclusively for internal
            use by the Controller, and for his own purposes. The Controller may
            request transfer to one or more processors (e.g. a parcel service)
            that also uses personal data for an internal purpose which is
            attributable to the Controller.
          </p>
          <p>
            {' '}
            By registering on the website of the Controller, the IP
            address—assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by
            the data subject—date, and time of the registration are also stored.
            The storage of this data takes place against the background that
            this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if
            necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses.
            Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the
            Controller. This data is not passed on to third parties unless there
            is a statutory obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer
            serves the aim of criminal prosecution.
          </p>
          <p>
            {' '}
            The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary indication
            of personal data, is intended to enable the Controller to offer the
            data subject contents or services that may only be offered to
            registered users due to the nature of the matter in question.
            Registered persons are free to change the personal data specified
            during the registration at any time, or to have them completely
            deleted from the data stock of the Controller.
          </p>
          <p>
            {' '}
            The data Controller shall, at any time, provide information upon
            request to each data subject as to what personal data are stored
            about the data subject. In addition, the data Controller shall
            correct or erase personal data at the request or indication of the
            data subject, insofar as there are no statutory storage obligations.
            Our Data Protection Officer is available to the data subject as
            contact persons.
          </p>
          <strong>
            7 Routine Erasure or Restriction of Processing of Personal Data
          </strong>
          <p>
            {' '}
            The data Controller shall process and store the personal data of the
            data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of
            storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or
            other legislators in laws or regulations to which the Controller is
            subject to.
          </p>
          <p>
            {' '}
            If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period
            prescribed by the European legislator or another competent
            legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or
            erased in accordance with legal requirements.
          </p>
          <strong>8 Rights of the Data Subject</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong> Right of confirmation</strong>
              Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European
              legislator to obtain from the Controller the confirmation as to
              whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being
              processed. If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right
              of confirmation, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee
              of the Controller.

              information. Furthermore, the European directives and regulations
              grant the data subject access to the following information:
              <ul>
                <li>the purposes of the processing;</li>

            On this website, the Controller has integrated the component of

            from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which
            sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a
            sub-page was viewed. Web analytics are mainly used for the
            optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit

            would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the
            information technology system of the data subject. In addition,
            cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any
            time via a web browser or other software programs.

            {' '}
            In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a
            collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is
            related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of
            this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such. For this
            purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the
            link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and install it. This
            browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any
            data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be
            transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser
            add-ons is considered an objection by Google. If the information
            technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted,
            or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser
            add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on was
            uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is
            attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is
            possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the
            browser add-ons.

            11 Data Protection Provisions concerning the Application and Use of
            Social Media
          </strong>
          On this website, the Controller has integrated components of LinkedIn,
          Twitter and Telegram. With each call-up to one of the individual pages
          of this website, which is operated by the Controller and on which a
          social media component was integrated, the internet browser on the
          information technology system of the data subject is automatically
          prompted to download a display of the corresponding social media
          component. During the course of this technical procedure, the above-
          mentioned social media websites and Google gain knowledge of what
          specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject.
          <strong>12 Legal Basis for the Processing</strong>
          <p>
            {' '}
            Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing
            operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing
            purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the
            performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is
            the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for
            the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing
            is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such
            processing operations which are necessary for carrying out
            pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries
            concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a
            legal obligation by
          </p>
          <p>
            {' '}
            which processing of personal data is required, such as for the
            fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1)
            lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be
            necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of
            another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a
            visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health
            insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on
            to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing
            would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing
            operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal
            basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any
            of the above mentioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for
            the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or
            by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the
            interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
            which require protection of personal data. Such processing
            operations are particularly permissible because they have been
            specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered
            that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a
            client of the Controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR). Where the
            processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our
            legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the
            well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.
          </p>
          <strong>13 Period of storage of personal data</strong>
          <p>
            {' '}
            The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal
            data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiration
            of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long
            as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or
            the initiation of a contract.
          </p>
          <p>
            {' '}
            We would like to clarify that the provision of personal data is
            partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result
            from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual
            partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that
            the data subject provides us with personal data, which must
            subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example,
            obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a
            contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data
            would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject
            could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data
            subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee
            clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal
            data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the
            conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to
            provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of
            the personal data. In addition, we do not use automatic
            decision-making or profiling.
