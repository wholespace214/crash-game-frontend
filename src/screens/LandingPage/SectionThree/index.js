          When you sign up to Alpacasino Alpha, not only do you receive 5,000 play
          money
          {TOKEN_NAME} Tokens to use on our platform but the more you play, the
          more chances to win there are, we have hidden more ways to earn more
          {TOKEN_NAME} tokens which means a higher chance of climbing to the top
          of our weekly and monthly community leaderboards. But I know what you
          are thinking “How can I win that real money, how can I get those {TOKEN_NAME}
          tokens?” It’s easy, at the end of each week and month, we will reward
          our highest performing players with up to 20k in {TOKEN_NAME} that can of
          course be used when we go live on Mainnet. Each week and each month
          the leaderboards reset back down to zero and you can start winning all
          over again.

        <p className={classes.textParagraph}>
          And of course, the more you play, the more you earn.
